TODO:
0. MAKE SURE YOU START SERVER IN ROOT!!! NOT CLIENT!!!
1. start one drink layout


NOTES:
1. Decide on views/routing -WE ARE GOING TO USE ROUTING
   1. What happens when you click on one drink?
2. How do we store and consume images?
   1. Will the user upload their own photos?  Will we need links to public urls?
   -- Get images of glasses- that is the default-- you can upload your own photos (locally bc we will each have our own)


Resources:
Start the server: PORT=3001 node bin/www
Start clint: npm start

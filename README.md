TODO:
0. MAKE SURE YOU START SERVER IN ROOT!!! NOT CLIENT!!!
1. Inside DrinkCard and DrinkDetail - figure out how to dynamically import image
2. Figure out bug with routing
3. Create Route
4. Delete Route
5. Edit Route

On 04-19:
- continue with layout for CreateDrink.jsx- resolve console warnings

NOTES:
1. How do we store and consume images?
   1. Will the user upload their own photos?  Will we need links to public urls?
   -- Get images of glasses- that is the default-- you can upload your own photos (locally bc we will each have our own)


Resources:
Start the server: PORT=3001 node bin/www
Start clint: npm start
